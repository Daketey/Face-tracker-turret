# Face Tracking Turret 

An application made in Visual Studio 2019 using Windows forms App to detect human face and eyes, which blinks a led in response to 
detecting a face infront of the camera. The led circuit was made using an Arduino and the idea was that, the led should blink when it detects a face and it should stop blinking upon not seeing one.
