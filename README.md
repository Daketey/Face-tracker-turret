# Face Detection using EmguCV and Arduino.

An application made in Visual Studio 2019 using Windows forms App to detect human face and eyes, which blinks a led in response to 
detecting a face infront of camera. The led circuit was made using an Arduino. The idea was that, the led should blink when it detects a face and it should stop blinking upon not seeing one. 

Currently the libraries used are:
1. Aforge.Video (for taking live video feed from my computer)
2. EmguCV 

(All libararies and packages were downloaded using NuGet)
